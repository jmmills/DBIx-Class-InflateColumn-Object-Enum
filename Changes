        - Expanded testing database and tap tests to test for varchar 
          nullable and non-nullable and database native enum nullable 
          and non-nullable 
        - Fixed a implmentation for Object::Enum->new so that columns value
          on inflation is set correctly. This could have been considered
          a nasty bug. Discovered through new tests.
        - Added sanity check for inflation value set for invalid values so 
          that we don't get Object::Enum's die for invalid value as I don't
          like that behavior. Maybe a column_info to control check would be 
          more reasonable?
        - Changed allowable values usages from values column_info property
          to extra->list property to make this modules usage fall more 
          inline with how SQL::Translator handles native enum database
          types. As per suggestion from Bernhard Graf.
	- Added to code to enable smarter default_value handling
